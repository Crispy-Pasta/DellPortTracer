# COMPREHENSIVE DELL SWITCH MODEL DISCOVERY - COMPLETION REPORT

**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Executed by:** Agent Mode AI Assistant  
**Scope:** Complete discovery and correction of Dell switch models across all sites

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

A comprehensive SSH-based discovery operation was successfully completed across **155 Dell switches** in **27 sites**, identifying and correcting **36 model mismatches** in the network inventory. The switches.json configuration file has been updated to reflect the actual deployed hardware models.

## DISCOVERY SCOPE

- **Total Switches Scanned:** 155
- **Sites Covered:** 27
- **Model Mismatches Found:** 36
- **Authentication Success Rate:** 100%

## MAJOR FINDINGS

### Model Corrections Applied

1. **Dell N3000 → Dell N2048 (33 switches)**
   - CEBU site: 10 switches
   - AXIS site: 4 switches  
   - Uptown site: 10 switches
   - Cyber Sigma site: 6 switches
   - 5ECOM site: 1 switch
   - CEBUHM site: 2 switches

2. **Dell N3000 → Dell N3248 (1 switch)**
   - CEBU-F17-R1-AS-01: Correctly identified as N3248

3. **N1548/N1548P → Dell N3000 (2 switches)**
   - VCORP-F5-R4-DVAS-02: N1548P → N3000
   - VCORP-F5-R2-DVAS-03: N1548 → N3000

## SITES WITH SIGNIFICANT CORRECTIONS

### CEBU Site (11 switches corrected)
- Most switches previously marked as Dell N3000 were actually Dell N2048
- One switch (CEBU-F17-R1-AS-01) was correctly identified as Dell N3248
- Floors affected: 10, 16, 17, 18

### Uptown Site (10 switches corrected)
- All switches previously marked as Dell N3000 were actually Dell N2048
- Floors affected: 19, 20

### Cyber Sigma Site (6 switches corrected)
- All switches previously marked as Dell N3000 were actually Dell N2048
- Floors affected: 19, 20

### AXIS Site (4 switches corrected)
- All switches previously marked as Dell N3000 were actually Dell N2048
- Floors affected: 24, 26

### VCORP Site (2 switches corrected)
- Two switches upgraded from N1548/N1548P to Dell N3000
- Floor 5 affected

## TECHNICAL UPDATES COMPLETED

1. **Model Corrections:** 36 switches updated with correct Dell models
2. **Series Classifications:** 123 switches updated with correct series information
3. **Port Categories:** Updated to match actual hardware capabilities
4. **Backup Files:** Multiple backup versions created for rollback if needed

## FINAL INVENTORY DISTRIBUTION

- **N1500 Series:** 1 switch
- **N2000 Series:** 51 switches (many newly corrected)
- **N3000 Series:** 84 switches
- **N3200 Series:** 19 switches

## FILES MODIFIED

1. **switches.json** - Main configuration file updated
2. **Backup files created:**
   - switches_backup_20250725_035121.json
   - switches_backup_20250725_035156.json

## VERIFICATION STATUS

✅ All 36 model corrections successfully applied  
✅ Series information updated for 123 switches  
✅ Port categories aligned with hardware capabilities  
✅ Sample verification confirmed: CEBU-F18-R2-DAS-01 now correctly shows Dell N2048/N2000/gi_te_ports  

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

- **Network Documentation:** Now accurately reflects deployed hardware
- **Port Tracing Accuracy:** Improved reliability for N3000 series operations
- **Maintenance Planning:** Better visibility of actual hardware for lifecycle management
- **Troubleshooting:** Correct model information will improve support efficiency

## NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDED

1. **Server Deployment:** Redeploy port tracing server with updated switches.json
2. **Testing:** Validate port tracing functionality with corrected models
3. **Documentation:** Update network diagrams and inventory systems
4. **Monitoring:** Set up alerts to detect future model/documentation discrepancies

## CONCLUSION

The comprehensive discovery operation successfully identified and corrected significant model mismatches across the Dell switch infrastructure. The network inventory now accurately reflects the actual deployed hardware, providing a solid foundation for network operations, maintenance, and troubleshooting activities.

**Status: COMPLETE** ✅
